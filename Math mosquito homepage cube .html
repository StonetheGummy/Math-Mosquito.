      <h5>How to find the derivative of a function</h4>
      <p class=calculus>Let's say there is a function. F(x)=x^2. To find the derivative of this we would do: [F(x+0.000000001)-F(x)]/0.00000000001.
      Let's do an example.</p>
      <ol id=derivatives>
  <li>First we write the formula: [F(x+0.000000001)-F(x)]/0.00000000001</li>
  <li>Next we use one of the derivative tricks listed below. F'(x)=2*x</li>
  <li>In this example there is not, but if need be factor out numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p class=calculus>The derivative of a function can be written as F'(x)=(Derivative)</p>
      <h5>Some tricks</h4>
      <ol id=tricks>
      <li>F(x)= x^n.  F'(x)=n*[x^(n-1)] </li>
          <li>F(x)= x. F'(x)=x </li>
              <li> F(x)= x/n. F'(x)= x*(n^-1) </li>
                  <li>F(x)= n/x. F'(x)= n*(x^-1)</li>
      </ol>

        <h2>What is Pi?</h2>
        <p>Pi is an trancendental number. This means that the digits of pi never end and do not repeat. Pi is the ratio of the diamater of a circle to its circumference. For example if the diamater of a circle is 3 and we wanted to find out the circumference we would multiply 3 by Pi which would give us aproxiamately 9.424777961. </p>
