  <h2>Electricity Project</h2>
  <h3>Basic Info</h3>
  <p>Our electricity project is one of the coolest ones ever.  We our designing our city!  We need a population of at least 20,000 and and estimated cost of everything.  Our city wants to be known as the greenest city, but they also don't want the cost to be that high.  Well, take a look at the image below!  There is a lot to it.</p>

  <p>That is part of one group's work.  See? They crammed all this stuff onto Navy Island!  They were really running out of space.  They made the image gargantuan!</p>
